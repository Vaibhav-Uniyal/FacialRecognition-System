# FacialRecognition-System
The System was created on Google Collab so the code is accordingly.

This system trains for the photos of the students from the databaseof the photos of the students and helps to mark the attendance of the students just by a photo.
In this the google sheets are updated directly just by running the code and the attendance is marked.
A mail is also generated for every student to let them know thier status of the respective class.

For the database a folder named "face_recognization" inside it another folder "faces" and then inside the faces folder create the folder with the name of respective students and then add multiple photos of the students from different angles. More the photos better the system.
